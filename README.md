# Rainmeter
Applets created for use in program "Rainmeter"

Rainmeter is a desktop program that I have used in the past to create custom desktop widgets for Windows.
The program uses widgets written in a text file to display certain images, hyperlinks, and derived data.
The program has lua integration as well allowing users to create code and integrate them into their widgets.

It's a unique program that I used quite a bit to create some unique platforms for my desktop.
